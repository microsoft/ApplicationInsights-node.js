# Application Insights for Node.js (Beta)

Application Insights SDK monitors your backend services and components after
you deploy them to help you discover and rapidly diagnose performance and other
issues. Add this SDK to your Node.js services to include deep info about Node.js
processes and their external dependencies such as database and cache services.
You can use this SDK for your Node.js services hosted anywhere: your datacenter,
Azure VMs and Web Apps, and even other public clouds. This solution is based on OpenTelemetry, to learn more about OpenTelemetry concepts, see the [OpenTelemetry overview](opentelemetry-overview.md) or [OpenTelemetry FAQ](/azure/azure-monitor/faq#opentelemetry).

> *Important:* The Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry-based Offerings for Node.js applications are currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Limitations of current preview release

Consider whether this preview is right for you. It *enables distributed tracing, metrics, logs* and _excludes_:

 - Live Metrics
 - Autopopulation of Cloud Role Name and Cloud Role Instance in Azure environments
 - Autopopulation of User ID and Authenticated User ID when you use the Application Insights JavaScript SDK
 - Autopopulation of User IP (to determine location attributes)
 - Ability to override Operation Name
 - Ability to manually set User ID or Authenticated User ID
 - Propagating Operation Name to Dependency Telemetry


> *Warning:* This SDK only works for Node.js environments. Use the [Application Insights JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS) for web and browser scenarios.


## Get started
Application Insights SDK internally consumes [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/monitor/monitor-opentelemetry), all relevant documentation is available in that package repository, it also exposes previous functionalities and APIs that were previously available to have a smother transtion for customers using previous versions of the package, including manual track APIs, for new customers we recommend to use @azure/monitor-opentelemetry instead.

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription: [Create an Azure subscription for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Application Insights resource: [Create an Application Insights resource](create-workspace-resource.md#create-a-workspace-based-resource)

- Application using an officially [supported version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/monitor/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter#currently-supported-environments) of Node.js runtime:
  - [OpenTelemetry supported runtimes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js#supported-runtimes)
  - [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Exporter supported runtimes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/monitor/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter#currently-supported-environments)

### Install the library

```sh
npm install applicationinsights@beta
```

### Enable Application Insights

> *Important:* `useAzureMonitor` must be called *before* you import anything else. There may be resulting telemetry loss if other libraries are imported first.


```typescript
const { useAzureMonitor, AzureMonitorOpenTelemetryOptions } = require("applicationinsights");

const config : AzureMonitorOpenTelemetryOptions = {
    azureMonitorExporterOptions: {
        connectionString: process.env["APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"] || "<your connection string>"
    }
};
useAzureMonitor(config);
```

* If the Connection String is set in the environment variable
  APPLICATIONINSIGHTS\_CONNECTION\_STRING, `TelemetryClient` constructor can be called with no
  arguments. This makes it easy to use different connection strings for different
  environments.


## Configuration

The ApplicationInsightsConfig interface provides a number of options to setup SDK behavior.

```typescript
const config : AzureMonitorOpenTelemetryOptions = {
     azureMonitorExporterOptions: {
        // Offline storage
        storageDirectory: "c://azureMonitor",
        // Automatic retries
        disableOfflineStorage: false,
        // Application Insights Connection String
        connectionString:   process.env["APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"] || "<your connection string>",
    },
    samplingRatio: 1,
    enableAutoCollectExceptions: true,
    enableAutoCollectStandardMetrics: true,
    enableAutoCollectPerformance: true,
    instrumentationOptions: {
        azureSdk: { enabled: true },
        http: { enabled: true },
        mongoDb: { enabled: true },
        mySql: { enabled: true },
        postgreSql: { enabled: true },
        redis: { enabled: true },
        redis4: { enabled: true },
    },
    resource: resource,
    logInstrumentationOptions: {
        console: { enabled: true},
        bunyan: { enabled: true},
        winston: { enabled: true},
    },
    extendedMetrics:{
        gc: true,
        heap: true,
        loop: true
    }

};
useAzureMonitor(config);

```

        }
    }
    ...
}
  
```

```javascript
process.env.APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_FILE = "C:/applicationinsights/config/customConfig.json"

// Application Insights SDK setup....
```

## ApplicationInsights Shim Unsupported Properties
The ApplicationInsights shim will provide support path for customers who only require basic instrumentation as opposed to migrating to the OpenTelemetry Distro. If unsupported methods are called, they are not breaking and your application will still run. Calling these unsupported methods will throw a warning that the method is not supported by the ApplicationInsights shim.

The following methods are called after using the below method.

```javascript
let applicationinsights = require("applicationinsights");
appinsights.setup("<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>").start();
```

And invoked via `appInsights.<METHOD_NAME>`
|Property                     |Support Status                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| setDistributedTracingMode   | AI only tracing mode is no longer supported. Migrate to using W3C_AND_AI tracing mode. |
| setAutoCollectHeartbeat     | Heartbeat is not supported in either the distro or the shim.|
| enableWebInstrumenatation   | WebInstrumentation is not supported in either the distro or the shim. |
| setAutoDependencyCorrelation| Turning off autoDependencyCorrelation is not supported by either the distro or the shim. |
| setUseDiskRetryCaching      | While enabling/disabling offline storage is supported, setting the resend interval or the maxBytesOnDisk values are not supported in the shim or the distro. |
| setAutoCollectIncomingRequestAzureFunctions | Auto collection of Azure Functions is not supported by the shim or the distro. |

The following configurations are set using either environment variables, setting them in the `applicationinsights.json` file or by calling `appInsights.defaultClient.config.<CONFIG_SETTING_VALUE>;`.

|Property               |Support Status                                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| instrumentationKey & endpointUrl | Not supported by the shim or the distro. Please migrate to using the connectionString. |
| maxBatchSize | Not supported by the shim but can be configured by using OpenTelemetry SpanProcessors in the distro. |
| disableAppInsights | Not supported by the shim. Disabling telemetry export is possible via the distro using OpenTelemetry.|
| correlationIdRetryIntervalMs | Not supported by either the shim or the distro as correlation ID is deprecated.|
| ignoreLegacyHeaders | Legacy headers in outgoing requests are not supported in the shim or the distro. Therefore they will always be disabled. |
| distributedTracingMode | Distributed tracing mode is always set to AI_AND_W3C. AI only tracing mode is not supported in the shim or the distro.|
| enableLoggerErrorToTrace | Not supported in the shim or the distro as all errors will be logged as exceptions in both. |
| enableAutoCollectHeartbeat | Heartbeat is not supported in the shim or the distro as it is deprecated. |
| enableAutoDependencyCorrelation | Cannot disable dependency correlation in either the shim or the distro. Dependency correlation will always be enabled and therefore this setting is always true. |
| enableAutoCollectIncomingRequestAzureFunctions | Not supported by the shim. Migrate to the distro to use auto collection of Azure Functions. |
| enableUseAsyncHooks | Using async hooks is not supported by the shim or the distro as it is not supported by OpenTelemetry. |
| enableResendInterval | Not supported by the shim. It is possible to configure the interval between exports via OpenTelemetry span processors, but not specifically cached events. The @azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter uses a resend interval of one minute. |
| enableMaxBytesOnDisk | Not supported by the shim. And not supported to be changed in the distro. The @azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter sets this value at 50MB. |
| noHttpAgentKeepAlive | Not supported in the shim or the distro. |
| httpAgent/httpsAgent | Not supported in the shim or the distro. |
| enableWebInstrumentation | Not currently supported in the shim or the distro. |
| webInstrumentationConnectionString | Not supported in the shim or the distro. |
| webInstrumentationConfig | Not currently supported by the shim or the distro. |

The following methods are part of the `TelemetryClient` class. They can be called using `applicationinsights.defaultClient.<METHOD_NAME>()`.

|Property       |                     Support Status              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| trackPageView | PageViewTelemetry requires an id and a name field now instead of only an optional name field. |
| track | Tracking generic telemetry is not longer supported. Please use one of the other manual track methods to track a specific telemetry type. | 
| getAuthorizationHandler | Not supported in the shim. |
| addTelemetryProcessor | TelemetryProcessors are not supported in the shim. Please migrate to the distro and use OpenTelemetry Span Processors. |
| clearTelemetryProcessors | TelemetryProcessors are not supported in the shim. Please migrate to the distro and use OpenTelemetry Span Processors. |

| trackNodeHttpDependency | Not supported. Please use the trackDependency method instead. |


## Troubleshooting

### Self-diagnostics


`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_LOGGING_LEVEL` environment varialbe could be used to set desired log level, supporting the following values: `NONE`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `VERBOSE` and  `ALL`.


Logs could be put into local file using `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_LOG_DESTINATION` environment variable, supported values are `file` and `file+console`, a file named `applicationinsights.log` will be generated on tmp folder by default, including all logs,  `/tmp` for *nix and `USERDIR/AppData/Local/Temp` for Windows. Log directory could be configured using `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_LOGDIR` environment variable.

```javascript
process.env.APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_LOGGING_LEVEL = "VERBOSE";
process.env.APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_LOG_DESTINATION = "file";
process.env.APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_LOGDIR = "C:/applicationinsights/logs";

// Application Insights SDK setup....
```
